Ask the user for two numbers. Convert these numbers to integers and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these two numbers.

Problem 2: Age in Seconds
Ask the user for their age in years. Assume that a year always has 365 days, and convert the age into seconds. Then print this value.

Problem 3: String Formatting and User Input
